Team players move an oval shaped ball by kicking, handballing or carried by a running palyer. 
At each end of the field there is a goal line which consists of two taller and central posts, the goalposts, 
and two outer shorter posts, the behind posts.
Points are scored kicking the ball either between the goalposts (+6 points) or between the behind posts (+1 point).
Other special cases applies for which a behind (+1 point) is assigned.
The winner team is the one with the higher total score at the end of the match.
Equal score means a draw.

number of goals, number of behinds, total score.
